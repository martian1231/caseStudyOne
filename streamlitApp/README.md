# Description

 Streamlit is an open source python library that is used to create data driven web app. Streamlit's beauty is in its "easy to use" library to create interactive web apps for machine learning and data science.

We have used Heroku to deploy our streamlit server. The main reason for using Heroku and not any other services is that, Heroku is really simple to use and you don't have to worry about managing infrastructure, services and so on.

To know more about deploying a python app on Heroku server have a look at [this](https://martian1231-py.medium.com/ashrae-great-energy-predictor-iii-a-machine-learning-self-case-study-5c9e9d0ea11d) post by me.
